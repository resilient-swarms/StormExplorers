Source: These Wave Glider data were submitted to NODC by Luke Beatman, Liquid 
        Robotics, via NODC FTP server.

Actions: NODC personnel "uncompressed" the submitted zip file under the directory
         data/0-data/ and then they removed the zip file.

Files:

This directory contains files generated by NODC with ancillary information
about the data submission.

0069043_lonlat.txt - Contains glider locations for these data.  Each row
                     contains the geographical position where these data were
                     collected (longitude in the left column and latitude in the
                     right column, both in degrees).  NODC may have corrected
                     geographic positions that seemed to be in error when
                     generating this file.  However, NODC did not change the
                     original data files under the directory data/0-data/.

0069043_map.jpg - Glider track location map for these data.
