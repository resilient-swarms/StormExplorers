PacX Mission Purpose



The PacX Mission was developed and executed with the intentions of showcasing 
the abilities of the Wave Glider while collecting an unprecedented amount of 
continuous data throughout the North and South Pacific Ocean.  These data are 
available to the public after a brief registration process, in the hopes that 
significant research conclusions can be made and published.  There was an 
additional component to the mission.  The PacX Challenge, an invitation to 
scientists of the world to compete for 6 months of Wave Glider time as well as 
a $50,000 research grant from BP, a sponsor of the mission.  The process started 
with a call for research proposals based on the use of the PacX dataset.  A 
scientific board was assembled to review the abstracts and select 5 finalists.  
The 5 finalists drafted a research paper based on their proposals.  These 
research papers are in the process of review by the PacX Challenge Science Board.  
An announcement of the winner will be at Ocean'13 in San Diego.
